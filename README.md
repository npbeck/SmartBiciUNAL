# About
This repository contains code for an Android application which served as a prototype for managing 
- on-campus bike access
- bike parking
- notifications in case of theft.

It is the result of a group work in the class 'Internet de las cosas' at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot√°.

# Components
While this code centers around an Android application, there are three components to be considered for the project
- mobile phone application for users (Android)
- central database storing e.g. ocupation of bike parks and entry and exit points of bikes on the campus (Google Firebase)
- Near Field Communication sensors placed at the bike parks and entry and exit points of the campus, registering activity of bikes
